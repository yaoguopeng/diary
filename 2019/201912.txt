  Today we talked about growing plants, she show me her dark green scindapsus growing in a bottle of water, green enough and couldn't be longger,
it looks so amazing that I couldn't help asking her what did she has done to the plant, and then she showed me the fertilizer -- some little solid particles
with white color -- which was for her mint -- a plant no longger live. yeah, the mints like sunshine, but her room is so dark that blooming her scindapsus.
I am growing plants too, cactus, aloe, and some succulent plants, interesting is that I have a cup of scindapsus too, I set my plants before the window, where 
much sunshine just like shower, except the scindapsus, they all grow flourish. the leaves of my scindapsus is a little light yellow seems like alomost the end 
it's life, I think it might be for the strong light, and I make my decision that it would be plant under my bed tomorrow. 
  Since we got a knowledge that diffrent kinds of plants have different living habits, mints like sunshine while scindapsus like dark light, cactus enjoy dry and 
the money tree would grow better when the soil is wet enough, etc. So I guess it would apply to the humanbeing on earth, kinds of different people, kinds of habits,
tempers, etc. A theory grew deep in my mind was that fats always the generous, such as the Budda, the Maitreya, they both wise and generous, but today, my theory of 
the fats down, a fat courier call me 5 times to ask me where I am -- the address is right on the items tips -- every time I told him patiently but maybe he was so nevous 
and with his accent that I couldn't hear him clearly, I just said "I can't hear you clearly" he turn up his sound and reviled, thanks god I finally got my lunch, he is a 
fat, but not fat as the Budda and the Maitreya. plants can easily classify by there looks but not mankind, we can't go get to know a person well just for a glimpse,
it takes a long time.

    How time flies when one is having fun, Friday again, good manmories came upon my mind make me so excited that I couldn't help phoning her again, thousands of thoughts
full of me my mind, seems like many scenes of movies which play by me and her, talking and laughing, whispering and smiling, or just being together, under a tree, on the way,
or just in a room... it's extremely hard to have a believe in I am so deep into her. Hang up my phone, walk down the stairs, I hope today was another last friday and the weekend
to come would be the same as last weekend. It's really a pity that I can't live in my imagination.

  Though today is a not so cold winter day, it's hard for me to get out of my bed in the morning, noting in particalar but an aware of I am fat again, I could't remember how long 
it's been I have my last running in the playground, seems I haven't got any sports since the weather gets colder and colder, I don't like winter at all. Eat too much and with no exercise 
make my weight grows flourish. Changes, changes must be maked. 
  It's easy to begin a good habit, but so hard to keep it. I swore that I would lost my weight months before, so I keep exercising a whole summer and I did thin for a little while. Not until
the winter's comming, the sports equiments in my room is cover by dirt little by little and the fat climb on my body again. I am stronger than what I have been, action is character, 
if I didn't do anything, I couldn't be anybody. I decide to have a running this night, and I hope it would be the beginning of a good habbit which supposed to be kept for a longer period. And 
so is finish the life with staying up late, I haven't been take a good sleep for a long time which I regard as the main reason that I am becoming forgetful these days.
  And so, sleep earlier, eat less and exercise more, I hope I would be healther and happier in this way. Keep & Hope.

   Consider my scindapsus is dying, I wonder if I should give them a last chance or just let them go -- plant them on soil downstairs in the garden -- in which way they would probably cover their green 
again. Maybe I just make things complicated, I did think about just throw them in dustbin and water another one. Idle enough to have so many strange ideas.  
   The sunshine was so warm this afternoon,lazily sleep on my tiny bed enjoy the warmth, I wish me a longer afternoon-snooze-time, there always feels like a monster in me that greedily eat my 
sleep which makes me sleepy all the time. remember last night, I run about 5 rounds along the track, and I feel bad, not until 11 pm, yawn and yawn again, too tired to keep my eyes open, maybe for the reason
that I had been stoped exercising for too long, even though, this night is another running night.
   One of my favorite stories comes to me "Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned.But the second one,he struggled so hard that he eventually churned that 
cream into butter, and walked out", anyway, I am going to be the second mouse. FIGHTING!!!

   I made soybean milk again, 7 peanuts, 3 walnuts and a little cup of bean with 1200ml water, delicious! I figure if I can make soybean milk with such amazing taste, there isn't anything I can't do.
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
   I woke up late this morning cause I set my alarm clock 15 minutes later than usual for I couldn't fall asleep until 2 am and I was so tired that I'd like to have a little more sleeping-time, even though,
the somnus-eat monster in me was still hungry, I tried making a nap after lunch but in vain, somebodies were talking all the time in the room. 
   Days ago, or maybe it was last week, I began to see a movie <500 days with Summer>, the movie last only one and a half hour or so, but it took me three nights and I didn't make it finish, I've seen the movie
before, it's great, I'd like to get a sourse that with English subtitles but I can't, try surfing the internet for a long time but get nothing. Maybe there were a version with English subtitles and I would finish
the movie once again. Remember that it's been a long time that I haven't seen new movies, a Korea TV play which I've seen the begining and to be finished, Japanese to learn, books to read,exercise... think about all
these, so many things to do, every minute count.

   Having my lunch at the school teachers' canteen for the first time, it taste just so so, but I think it's healthier than the food outside the school cause there were less oil. Today is just a not so busy Monday 
if she didn't tell me she's about to come again next week, I hope she can make it, next week or since the winter holiday. I'd like going to her too since she will finish her courses then. All around my head this 
afternoon is hopping to keep staying together with her, how I wish the time go faster these days and slow down since we're together.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I have a sore throat yesterday for haven't got enough of water because there were two long meetings, every time I got a sore throat it would change to be influenza, headache and then cough, then diarrhea, after all these
suffering which usually last about one week or two, the recovery comes to me slowly. I need a lot of water every day, they said we human being should have 8 glasses of water a day, I need more, 8 is far from enough, if I 
couldn't make it to get that much, a sore throat comes anyway, and then begin the horrible suffering, darn.
   However, life isn't always that bad, a good news is that she had made her decision to come this weekend, the funs of live come back to me again, lucky.
   I got a mission to learn new technology these days, learning and sharing, so the work come first is finding a new technology that useful and can finish the learning in weeks so I could have a speech on it next friday. 
SpringCloud is a good choice, but there are so many in it, seems impossible to learn and practice in such a short time, but I am collecting infomation about SpringBoot as my first step now. time limit, it's not an easy job, 
the only way -- with luck, forward.

   It's rainy all day long, cold and wet outside, it's said that mammals that live in arctic regions develop a layer of fat to insulate against the cold, the fat on me hasn't got that power, seems I'am not fat enough, 
anyway, happy Friday and happy weekend, looking forward to the comming of her.
