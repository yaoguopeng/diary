  It's the first day of 2020 today, another never-go-out day, clean and change my sheet, bedclothes .etc, have the clean ones basked. Have breakfast-lunch with my roommate, playing League Of Legends with my high-school friend for 
all the afternoon, after supper, I was about to have a nap, another game's invitation from after-college friends come, and we're playing that for about 3  hours, during the night-game time, I was talking with my girl by Wechat,
learning about the news about her and her friends, Fuyang is so cold today that she goes out with scarf and gloves which she wouldn't put on with anyway. We talk a lot, about everything, have fun, my life with her gets much more colorful.
I hope we could share more good memories such as a long trip. Happiness is we're together, all along.
  I feel sorry for me cause I've been staying up so late these days, and have playing games all the time, if it was put in study, I must have been a stronger one, just like the saying "You are stronger than what you have been" in the Lion King.
I'm stronger than what I have been. Action is character, if we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody. Action!!!

  I read several pages of <Spring Cloud in action> today, it's really hard to focus on page since I've long time no read, disturbed easily and thoughts were not under control. How wonderful if I could read books as carefully as play games. Reading 
makes me sleepy, I've been almost fall asleep for many times during my 2 huors reading time. Too tired to go on with my job or keep my attention to a book, I'd like to pull down the curtain, turn off my phone and lie on bed caring about nothing.
  I try to book my ticket back Hangzhou but failed which means maybe I have to fly back then. It's not a problem anyway.

  I was about to get up earlier this morning so I could cook my breakfast and lunch since the school teacher's dining hall is not available for no-teacher any more and it's cold out side which makes go out to have lunch seems hard to me. But too tired
to get up and it's so cold that I could hardly get out of my bed, after staying still for almost 20 minutes and I make it, get up and have a shower, brush teeth... after all these done, it's 8:43 already and I set out to work in a hurry, but late for 
the morning meeting. Never mind, not big deal. Have my lunch at Buy-Now-Way building takes almost half an hour, back and sit for minutes read some jokes with funny pictures, I quit my after lunch teeth brush habbit today since there's not more than 20
minutes rest time and my choice is sleep. Even though, I had my teeth brush after nap for din't feel comfortable at all with the no-brush teeth after eating. Have teeth brush after use them is really a good habbit.
  Friday, seems colder than any other days, it's the day to stay inside with her, biding the time. I found a wonderful music today -- Cheap Thrills -- which sounds happy and sings "I got all I need, No I ain't got cash,~,but I got you baby ... I don't 
need money, as long as I can feel the beat...", the lyrics looks beautiful too. It's really the most important thing, nothing is beyond we staying together.

  Not get up until afternoon, after breakfast-lunch, watch TV, play games, just like when I was a colleger on vacation. Life in this way is really comfortable enough.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20200105  SUN sunny
  Lie on bed for alomost all day long playing games or watching TV, killing the time. I plant a new cactus and I found my scindapsus revice after put under my bed for couple weeks, maybe a dark light environment is much more comfortable for a scindapsus.
  Her winter holiday begin, two of her roommates going home, the left one was considered keeping acompany with her until the day which she promise to her daddy to going back, but things didn't work in this way, her roommate is on date for several days. 
Since she was left alone, I am so afraid of she would feel lonely that I make up my mind to keep chating with her until she fall asleep. I hope I was there, keep her acompany.

  It's not that cold but I don't look good today, maybe for staying up too late these days, my back feel pain around waist several times when I get up from my site.The pain disappear after cups of hot water drinking this afternoon. I'd like to have a soup 
for dinner tonight. Days with bad habbits like staying up late must come to an end.

  The weather changes frequently, today is cold and wet again, lunch time, it's dark outside, I was about to have some rice for lunch, but I change my mind soon because the weather forecast showed the probability of rain is 100%, I just go down stair straight
into the seven-eleven, two buns and a box of milk, I am not that much appetitive these days, even though, I've put on more than 1kg of weight. 
  After hours I sent her several messages but got no response not even when I've finish dinner, so I try to call her but refused. Have a shower and play games with my friends, during the games time, she call me and ask if I'd play another game with her,
I was about to play with her later since I was playing the other game at that time, and I keep talking to her on the phone with playing game at the same time. Almost an hour later, we finish the game and I was going to play with her, but she was tired of it, 
5 times by herself, I think she didn't get a good mood at that time, play games alone and the last 3 times were defeated. Sorry for haven't stop to play with her at that time.

  Lost her, day 1. Said something wrong and she got mad at me, after calling her for 2 times she delete my Wechat and put my phone number into black list, regreted and couldn't fall asleep, so I turn to her roommate for help, hope she could bring me good news. I shouldn't 
have said that. Think about all these, words from just my mouth bring me troubles, look before you leap, if there's any chance I could get her figiveness, I would be a quiet man anyway. HOPE!!!
