20200101  WED sunny
  It's the first day of 2020 today, another never-go-out day, clean and change my sheet, bedclothes .etc, have the clean ones basked. Have breakfast-lunch with my roommate, playing League Of Legends with my high-school friend for 
all the afternoon, after supper, I was about to have a nap, another game's invitation from after-college friends come, and we're playing that for about 3  hours, during the night-game time, I was talking with my girl by Wechat,
learning about the news about her and her friends, Fuyang is so cold today that she goes out with scarf and gloves which she wouldn't put on with anyway. We talk a lot, about everything, have fun, my life with her gets much more colorful.
I hope we could share more good memories such as a long trip. Happiness is we're together, all along.
  I feel sorry for me cause I've been staying up so late these days, and have playing games all the time, if it was put in study, I must have been a stronger one, just like the saying "You are stronger than what you have been" in the Lion King.
I'm stronger than what I have been. Action is character, if we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody. Action!!!

20200102  THU cloudy
  I read several pages of <Spring Cloud in action> today, it's really hard to focus on page since I've long time no read, disturbed easily and thoughts were not under control. How wonderful if I could read books as carefully as play games. Reading 
makes me sleepy, I've been almost fall asleep for many times during my 2 huors reading time. Too tired to go on with my job or keep my attention to a book, I'd like to pull down the curtain, turn off my phone and lie on bed caring about nothing.
  I try to book my ticket back Hangzhou but failed which means maybe I have to fly back then. It's not a problem anyway.

20200103  FRI drizzle
  I was about to get up earlier this morning so I could cook my breakfast and lunch since the school teacher's dining hall is not available for no-teacher any more and it's cold out side which makes go out to have lunch seems hard to me. But too tired
to get up and it's so cold that I could hardly get out of my bed, after staying still for almost 20 minutes and I make it, get up and have a shower, brush teeth... after all these done, it's 8:43 already and I set out to work in a hurry, but late for 
the morning meeting. Never mind, not big deal. Have my lunch at Buy-Now-Way building takes almost half an hour, back and sit for minutes read some jokes with funny pictures, I quit my after lunch teeth brush habbit today since there's not more than 20
minutes rest time and my choice is sleep. Even though, I had my teeth brush after nap for din't feel comfortable at all with the no-brush teeth after eating. Have teeth brush after use them is really a good habbit.
  Friday, seems colder than any other days, it's the day to stay inside with her, biding the time. I found a wonderful music today -- Cheap Thrills -- which sounds happy and sings "I got all I need, No I ain't got cash,~,but I got you baby ... I don't 
need money, as long as I can feel the beat...", the lyrics looks beautiful too. It's really the most important thing, nothing is beyond we staying together.
