  "if I didn't care..." the music flash around my head all this night, yes, the begining of the move <The Shawshank Redemption> "Get busy living or get busy dying",
I walked down the stree by myself alone,at such a cold night,I saw a lot which make my brain full of kinds of strange thoughts.
   A shadow pathlet beside a river, some people are leisurely fishing there,on the contrary, the other side of the pathlet is a road which many vehicles running on with 
high speed, the honks blow in the wind, as Henry David Thoreau said, "how many radius could draw from the center of a circle, the ways of lives will have the same amounts",
people living on the same earth, share the same sun, but always not have the same life, there are so many choices in our lives that make every people different from each other.
Think about <Forrest Gump>,Jenny asked,"Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you're going to be? ", and he said "Aren't I going to be me? ",yes, I'd like to just be myself too,
neither one of the fishing peoples nor one of the drivers, but me myself, a passager enjoy the quiet night with inner peace, it would be better there was a companion, and it would
be much better the companion was my lover, and that's enough.
  Yes,as this moment, I think life is easier when we want less.

  Today we talked about growing plants, she show me her dark green scindapsus growing in a bottle of water, green enough and couldn't be longger,
it looks so amazing that I couldn't help asking her what did she has done to the plant, and then she showed me the fertilizer -- some little solid particles
with white color -- which was for her mint -- a plant no longger live. yeah, the mints like sunshine, but her room is so dark that blooming her scindapsus.
I am growing plants too, cactus, aloe, and some succulent plants, interesting is that I have a cup of scindapsus too, I set my plants before the window, where 
much sunshine just like shower, except the scindapsus, they all grow flourish. the leaves of my scindapsus is a little light yellow seems like alomost the end 
it's life, I think it might be for the strong light, and I make my decision that it would be plant under my bed tomorrow. 
  Since we got a knowledge that diffrent kinds of plants have different living habits, mints like sunshine while scindapsus like dark light, cactus enjoy dry and 
the money tree would grow better when the soil is wet enough, etc. So I guess it would apply to the humanbeing on earth, kinds of different people, kinds of habits,
tempers, etc. A theory grew deep in my mind was that fats always the generous, such as the Budda, the Maitreya, they both wise and generous, but today, my theory of 
the fats down, a fat courier call me 5 times to ask me where I am -- the address is right on the items tips -- every time I told him patiently but maybe he was so nevous 
and with his accent that I couldn't hear him clearly, I just said "I can't hear you clearly" he turn up his sound and reviled, thanks god I finally got my lunch, he is a 
fat, but not fat as the Budda and the Maitreya. plants can easily classify by there looks but not mankind, we can't go get to know a person well just for a glimpse,
it takes a long time.

    How time flies when one is having fun, Friday again, good manmories came upon my mind make me so excited that I couldn't help phoning her again, thousands of thoughts
full of me my mind, seems like many scenes of movies which play by me and her, talking and laughing, whispering and smiling, or just being together, under a tree, on the way,
or just in a room... it's extremely hard to have a believe in I am so deep into her. Hang up my phone, walk down the stairs, I hope today was another last friday and the weekend
to come would be the same as last weekend. It's really a pity that I can't live in my imagination.

   Last night was a sleepless night, I have to sleep all day long to get myself charged, just like a hibernant bear, lie on my bed cover by quilt, binding my time, I was about 
to keep doing like this all this winter with an empty mind, empty stomach, but it's really hard for me, as usual, I phone he, we talked everything, I couldn't imagine I am such 
conversable, I am happy when she's happy, I am down when there seems a sigh that she isn't, it's really a bad thing I can't control my mind, yes, I hope I am strong enough 
someday.
   After dinner, I taked a walk, just go forward along the road, colorful lights, busy passagers, everything goes in it's old way, but a barbershop I have my hair cut two weeks ago
, it comes to be a shoes store now, "The only thing that permanent is change" comes to me again, and so is about cherish, I did create a Cherish-Day a couple weeks ago. Though the
Cherish-Day would just be celebrate at the fourth week's Sataday of November every year, the ideology of cherish would go deep in my daily life.

  Though today is a not so cold winter day, it's hard for me to get out of my bed in the morning, noting in particalar but an aware of I am fat again, I could't remember how long 
it's been I have my last running in the playground, seems I haven't got any sports since the weather gets colder and colder, I don't like winter at all. Eat too much and with no exercise 
make my weight grows flourish. Changes, changes must be maked. 
  It's easy to begin a good habit, but so hard to keep it. I swore that I would lost my weight months before, so I keep exercising a whole summer and I did thin for a little while. Not until
the winter's comming, the sports equiments in my room is cover by dirt little by little and the fat climb on my body again. I am stronger than what I have been, action is character, 
if I didn't do anything, I couldn't be anybody. I decide to have a running this night, and I hope it would be the beginning of a good habbit which supposed to be kept for a longer period. And 
so is finish the life with staying up late, I haven't been take a good sleep for a long time which I regard as the main reason that I am becoming forgetful these days.
  And so, sleep earlier, eat less and exercise more, I hope I would be healther and happier in this way. Keep & Hope.

   Consider my scindapsus is dying, I wonder if I should give them a last chance or just let them go -- plant them on soil downstairs in the garden -- in which way they would probably cover their green 
again. Maybe I just make things complicated, I did think about just throw them in dustbin and water another one. Idle enough to have so many strange ideas.  
   The sunshine was so warm this afternoon,lazily sleep on my tiny bed enjoy the warmth, I wish me a longer afternoon-snooze-time, there always feels like a monster in me that greedily eat my 
sleep which makes me sleepy all the time. remember last night, I run about 5 rounds along the track, and I feel bad, not until 11 pm, yawn and yawn again, too tired to keep my eyes open, maybe for the reason
that I had been stoped exercising for too long, even though, this night is another running night.
   One of my favorite stories comes to me "Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned.But the second one,he struggled so hard that he eventually churned that 
cream into butter, and walked out", anyway, I am going to be the second mouse. FIGHTING!!!

   Today is the 16th day of this lunar month and the moon is big enough and bright enough, it looks beautiful, but I don't feel good at all, I feel so cold I wish we were together tonight.

   I woke up late this morning cause I set my alarm clock 15 minutes later than usual for I couldn't fall asleep until 2 am and I was so tired that I'd like to have a little more sleeping-time, even though,
the somnus-eat monster in me was still hungry, I tried making a nap after lunch but in vain, somebodies were talking all the time in the room. 
   Days ago, or maybe it was last week, I began to see a movie <500 days with Summer>, the movie last only one and a half hour or so, but it took me three nights and I didn't make it finish, I've seen the movie
before, it's great, I'd like to get a sourse that with English subtitles but I can't, try surfing the internet for a long time but get nothing. Maybe there were a version with English subtitles and I would finish
the movie once again. Remember that it's been a long time that I haven't seen new movies, a Korea TV play which I've seen the begining and to be finished, Japanese to learn, books to read,exercise... think about all
these, so many things to do, every minute count.
