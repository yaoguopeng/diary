  "if I didn't care..." the music flash around my head all this night, yes, the begining of the move <The Shawshank Redemption> "Get busy living or get busy dying",
I walked down the stree by myself alone,at such a cold night,I saw a lot which make my brain full of kinds of strange thoughts.
   A shadow pathlet beside a river, some people are leisurely fishing there,on the contrary, the other side of the pathlet is a road which many vehicles running on with 
high speed, the honks blow in the wind, as Henry David Thoreau said, "how many radius could draw from the center of a circle, the ways of lives will have the same amounts",
people living on the same earth, share the same sun, but always not have the same life, there are so many choices in our lives that make every people different from each other.
Think about <Forrest Gump>,Jenny asked,"Do you ever dream, Forrest, about who you're going to be? ", and he said "Aren't I going to be me? ",yes, I'd like to just be myself too,
neither one of the fishing peoples nor one of the drivers, but me myself, a passager enjoy the quiet night with inner peace, it would be better there was a companion, and it would
be much better the companion was my lover, and that's enough.
  Yes,as this moment, I think life is easier when we want less.

  Today we talked about growing plants, she show me her dark green scindapsus growing in a bottle of water, green enough and couldn't be longger,
it looks so amazing that I couldn't help asking her what did she has done to the plant, and then she showed me the fertilizer -- some little solid particles
with white color -- which was for her mint -- a plant no longger live. yeah, the mints like sunshine, but her room is so dark that blooming her scindapsus.
I am growing plants too, cactus, aloe, and some succulent plants, interesting is that I have a cup of scindapsus too, I set my plants before the window, where 
much sunshine just like shower, except the scindapsus, they all grow flourish. the leaves of my scindapsus is a little light yellow seems like alomost the end 
it's life, I think it might be for the strong light, and I make my decision that it would be plant under my bed tomorrow. 
  Since we got a knowledge that diffrent kinds of plants have different living habits, mints like sunshine while scindapsus like dark light, cactus enjoy dry and 
the money tree would grow better when the soil is wet enough, etc. So I guess it would apply to the humanbeing on earth, kinds of different people, kinds of habits,
tempers, etc. A theory grew deep in my mind was that fats always the generous, such as the Budda, the Maitreya, they both wise and generous, but today, my theory of 
the fats down, a fat courier call me 5 times to ask me where I am -- the address is right on the items tips -- every time I told him patiently but maybe he was so nevous 
and with his accent that I couldn't hear him clearly, I just said "I can't hear you clearly" he turn up his sound and reviled, thanks god I finally got my lunch, he is a 
fat, but not fat as the Budda and the Maitreya. plants can easily classify by there looks but not mankind, we can't go get to know a person well just for a glimpse,
it takes a long time.

    How time flies when one is having fun, Friday again, good manmories came upon my mind make me so excited that I couldn't help phoning her again, thousands of thoughts
full of me my mind, seems like many scenes of movies which play by me and her, talking and laughing, whispering and smiling, or just being together, under a tree, on the way,
or just in a room... it's extremely hard to have a believe in I am so deep into her. Hang up my phone, walk down the stairs, I hope today was another last friday and the weekend
to come would be the same as last weekend. It's really a pity that I can't live in my imagination.

20191207 SAT   sunny	
   Last night was a sleepless night, I have to sleep all day long to get myself charged, just like a hibernant bear, lie on my bed cover by quilt, biding my time, I was about 
to keep doing like this all this winter with an empty mind, empty stomach, but it's really hard for me, as usual, I phone her, we talked everything, I couldn't imagine I am such 
conversable, I am happy when she's happy, I am down when there seems a sigh that she isn't, it's really a bad thing I can't control my mind, yes, I hope I am strong enough 
someday.
   After dinner, I taked a walk, just go forward along the road, colorful lights, busy passagers, everything goes in it's old way, but a barbershop I have my hair cut two weeks ago
, it comes to be a shoes store now, "The only thing that permanent is change" comes to me again, and so is about cherish, I did create a Cherish-Day a couple weeks ago. Though the
Cherish-Day would just be celebrate at the fourth week's Sataday of November every year, the ideology of cherish would go deep in my daily life.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20191208 SUN sunny
  I treat my friends today, eating and drinking, talking and laughing, playing games... seems life is full of fun, it would be the best if she was there.

  Though today is a not so cold winter day, it's hard for me to get out of my bed in the morning, noting in particalar but an aware of I am fat again, I could't remember how long 
it's been I have my last running in the playground, seems I haven't got any sports since the weather gets colder and colder, I don't like winter at all. Eat too much and with no exercise 
make my weight grows flourish. Changes, changes must be maked. 
  It's easy to begin a good habit, but so hard to keep it. I swore that I would lost my weight months before, so I keep exercising a whole summer and I did thin for a little while. Not until
the winter's comming, the sports equiments in my room is cover by dirt little by little and the fat climb on my body again. I am stronger than what I have been, action is character, 
if I didn't do anything, I couldn't be anybody. I decide to have a running this night, and I hope it would be the beginning of a good habbit which supposed to be kept for a longer period. And 
so is finish the life with staying up late, I haven't been take a good sleep for a long time which I regard as the main reason that I am becoming forgetful these days.
  And so, sleep earlier, eat less and exercise more, I hope I would be healther and happier in this way. Keep & Hope.

   Consider my scindapsus is dying, I wonder if I should give them a last chance or just let them go -- plant them on soil downstairs in the garden -- in which way they would probably cover their green 
again. Maybe I just make things complicated, I did think about just throw them in dustbin and water another one. Idle enough to have so many strange ideas.  
   The sunshine was so warm this afternoon,lazily sleep on my tiny bed enjoy the warmth, I wish me a longer afternoon-snooze-time, there always feels like a monster in me that greedily eat my 
sleep which makes me sleepy all the time. remember last night, I run about 5 rounds along the track, and I feel bad, not until 11 pm, yawn and yawn again, too tired to keep my eyes open, maybe for the reason
that I had been stoped exercising for too long, even though, this night is another running night.
   One of my favorite stories comes to me "Two little mice fell into a bucket of cream.The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned.But the second one,he struggled so hard that he eventually churned that 
cream into butter, and walked out", anyway, I am going to be the second mouse. FIGHTING!!!

   Today is the 16th day of this lunar month and the moon is big enough and bright enough, it looks beautiful, but I don't feel good at all, I feel so cold I wish we were together tonight.

   I woke up late this morning cause I set my alarm clock 15 minutes later than usual for I couldn't fall asleep until 2 am and I was so tired that I'd like to have a little more sleeping-time, even though,
the somnus-eat monster in me was still hungry, I tried making a nap after lunch but in vain, somebodies were talking all the time in the room. 
   Days ago, or maybe it was last week, I began to see a movie <500 days with Summer>, the movie last only one and a half hour or so, but it took me three nights and I didn't make it finish, I've seen the movie
before, it's great, I'd like to get a sourse that with English subtitles but I can't, try surfing the internet for a long time but get nothing. Maybe there were a version with English subtitles and I would finish
the movie once again. Remember that it's been a long time that I haven't seen new movies, a Korea TV play which I've seen the begining and to be finished, Japanese to learn, books to read,exercise... think about all
these, so many things to do, every minute count.

20191213 FRI sunny
  It's sad that 1.3kg of weight climbed on  my body theses monthes, I should be on a forever diet, since I put on weight easily. And it's almost the New Year, when so much delicious
food to eat, lost weight would be extremely hard at that time. I am very hungry as this moment, but when I looked at the clock, I said no to me myself.
  Life is not about words but actions, eat less, exercise more, love and to be loved, tomorrow will be better.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20191214 SAT cloudy
  Sataday again, much of the waking time I've been playing games, but it didn't bring me any happiness,I missed her very much, an idea of celebrate her birthday next month
come and come again,I hope we're together, especially in those special days, we can do something unusual such as eat some steaks and drink some wine, go to a movie, 
hand in hand and have a walk along the lake enjoy the quite night... or just biding time,lie in the bed for a whole day, eat junk food when hungry and drinking while
thirsty, anyway, just be together and let the time went by.
  It's late enough, a song come to me "que sera sera, whatever will be will be, the future's not ours to see, que sera sera...", yes, just que sera sera.

  I bought a coat --has been put in my shopping cart for a long time, I like the bear head on it's back very much, and couldn't help look at it for many times-- on the internet
two days ago and it comes to me today, the bear head on it looks so nice, and the coat itself looks beautiful too, but it doesn't look good on me, what a pity, I haven't got such a 
body to suit it. There is a story, says one would like a diamond 4 than a K when he has got 3 card 4 already in poker games even though a K is greater than a 4 itself, and so is the 
coat, it's great enough itself, but not for me, and I have to send it back.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20191216 MON mostly-cloudy
   Having my lunch at the school teachers' canteen for the first time, it taste just so so, but I think it's healthier than the food outside the school cause there were less oil. Today is just a not so busy Monday 
if she didn't tell me she's about to come again next week, I hope she can make it, next week or since the winter holiday. I'd like going to her too since she will finish her courses then. All around my head this 
afternoon is hopping to keep staying together with her, how I wish the time go faster these days and slow down since we're together.

   I have a sore throat yesterday for haven't got enough of water because there were two long meetings, every time I got a sore throat it would change to be influenza, headache and then cough, then diarrhea, after all these
suffering which usually last about one week or two, the recovery comes to me slowly. I need a lot of water every day, they said we human being should have 8 glasses of water a day, I need more, 8 is far from enough, if I 
couldn't make it to get that much, a sore throat comes anyway, and then begin the horrible suffering, darn.
   However, life isn't always that bad, a good news is that she had made her decision to come this weekend, the funs of live come back to me again, lucky.
   I got a mission to learn new technology these days, learning and sharing, so the work come first is finding a new technology that useful and can finish the learning in weeks so I could have a speech on it next friday. 
SpringCloud is a good choice, but there are so many in it, seems impossible to learn and practice in such a short time, but I am collecting infomation about SpringBoot as my first step now. time limit, it's not an easy job, 
the only way -- with luck, forward.

  My influenza seems worse, and the worse is I didn't get enough sleep last night which make me inactive the whole day, I don't want to have a movement neither a thought inside. I got a conclusion that my temperament is softer 
since I finish my college study, and soft all the time to anybody, a long time ago, but it's wrong, I am not always that kind, especially when I am in my suffer say an influenza or being lack of sleep, I am not under my control, 
I don't want to talk, just in the zone. Remember I was shouting so loud last night to my friend when we were playing games, and so is this morning, my roommate said hello to me and I responsed with noting, not even fake a smile, 
too tired to have any extra body movement or any inner thinking. I ate breakfast as usual with the same amounts, maybe my stomach is sleepy too, I felt full even the luch time came. All my desires are not food but a long time sleep. 
  The weather is dark outside, looks like the sky has been cover by a blanket, seems the best way to celebrate the weather is to keep staying in bed, enjoy the warmth of quilt. She showed me a wintersweet, and we talked about 
wether we would go to the Hangzhou arboretum to have look this weekend, the conclusion is no, laying in the bed always the best way to enjoy a such weather weekend. Ha-ha, that's us. I would spend a weekend just inside my
room in such winter day, while with the coming of her, I'd like to have something special to do -- in order to make good memories. And it's been a whole month since we get together, remember it was the very night a month before,
almost 0 o'clock, to be specific, it's 23:40, the vitality of life comes back from that on, how I hope we could stay together now so as to celebrate it tonight. And so is the Cherish-Day, the festival I created, we meet at Hangzhou
station, about 3 o'clock, and so is the coming by weekends and the Monday which the wrong taxi accident brought, three days we had fun together, these meaningful moments, I'd like to write them down, print deep into my manmories.
Walked along the westlake, take candies from the dentist, missed the train for take a taxi with wrong destination and she didn't complain a word. The delicious we having together cola-chicken-wings, instant noodles, chops soup and
so on, I do hope there're much more.

   Another busy day because something must be done last week was left out by accident, I haven't write so many code in a day for a long time, uncomfortable feelings caught my hands after typing for this whole day, especially the 
little finger of the left one, today is colder than yesterday, the internet said that it's snowing outside, but I found not even a piece of snowflake, cold and rain in the morning, lift my umbrella, made me missed my gloves, and 
I search them in my trunk, they will be needed tomorrow too. Enven though the colder and colder winter and there're so many things to do, tomorrow still a beautiful day, cause it's Friday again and the happiest thing is she is 
comming again, how wonderful. Hope it would be warm up this weekend so we could go outside and have fun.
  And so is the menu: fried rice with egg, cola-chicken-wings, chops soup with corn or Chinese yam, pickled cucumber, boil broccoli, noodles, pitaya, tomato egg...     
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20191220 FRI rain
     It's rainy all day long, cold and wet outside, it's said that mammals that live in arctic regions develop a layer of fat to insulate against the cold, the fat on me hasn't got that power, seems I'am not fat enough, 
anyway, happy Friday and happy weekend, looking forward to the comming of her.
